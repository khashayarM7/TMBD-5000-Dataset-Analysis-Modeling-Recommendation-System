# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains code for a comprehensive movie recommendation system developed in Python. The system incorporates various data analysis, visualization, and modeling techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Explore and visualize movie data to gain insights into industry trends, popular genres, top production companies, and more.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict movie success using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost.
- **Content-Based Recommendation**: Recommend similar movies based on content using TF-IDF and count-based similarity approaches.
- **Advanced Recommendation Functionality**: Provide movie recommendations for a given title, leveraging both content-based similarity and collaborative filtering techniques.

## Getting Started

To use the movie recommendation system:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to analyze movie data, train machine learning models, and generate movie recommendations.

## Usage

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize movie data using Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts provided in the `analysis` directory.
- **Machine Learning**: Train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting movie success using Python scripts in the `modeling` directory.
- **Recommendation System**: Generate movie recommendations based on user preferences using functions provided in the `recommendation` directory.
